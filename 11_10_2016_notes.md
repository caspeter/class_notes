# Express Server and RESTful Express HTTP Server

Where do we find what the client is telling us?

​	URL Paramaters - req.params

```javascript
app.get(“/user/:name”, function (requires){
        var name = req.params.name;
        res.send(“Hello, “ + name);
    });
```

`:name` says that whatever they input, will be the value for the key name

Query parameters - `req.query`

```javascript
app.get(“/“, function (requires){
        var name = req.query;
        res.send(“Query Received”);
    });
```

client = browsers

## Build and Burn

`take _______________` - creates a folder and brings you into it

Once in folder that has the folder inside of it, meaning you can ls and see the folder you want to delete 

**DELETE:** `rm -r folder_name`
