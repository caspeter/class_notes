# Node.js

Node.js - another environment that can run JavaScript code. It allows JavaScript to run on the server

Why run JavaScript server side?

​	easier for front end people to work on both sides

​	utilize the same code on both sides - server and client

Where does Node.js fit in?

​	has the same v8 code that Google has. Node extends the functionality of the v8 engine to provide these features

Node.js is missing a lot of features

Node Modules / NPM

* an efficient way to package code
* reusing code you have already wrote, or that others have already wrote

InClass example

Sync vs Async

​	sync is known as blocking

## NPM - Node Package Manager

* Explain the purpose of NPM install global module

  to reuse your own code

  keeps data consistent

  code more portable

  get other people's code

  make sure packages are updated

* Install a global module

  module_name - g

* Initialize NPM

  `npm init`

* Install package NPM

  be in the folder

  `npm install module_name --save`

* Explain the purpose of the package.json file

  save dependancies

  saves data about the folder

* explain server

  ​

## Node Modules

* explain what a node.js module is

  a JavaScript file that contains some code

  a package is a module

* split existing code into two modules

* export and require a function and on object



Core modules are built into node

NPM modules are inside packages that can be downloaded and installed

File modules are built by you and saved locally in a js file
