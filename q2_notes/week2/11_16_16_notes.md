# Entity Relationship Diagrams

**entity relationship diagram** (ER diagram) is a drawing that represents people, places, or things that are inter-related

example:

```
┌──────────────┐       ┌─────────────────┐       ┌──────────────┐       ┌──────────────┐
│              │     ╱│                 │╲      │              │     ╱│              │
│    actors    │───────│  actors_movies  │───────│    movies    │───────│    awards    │
│              │     ╲│                 │╱      │              │     ╲│              │
└──────────────┘       └─────────────────┘       └──────────────┘       └──────────────┘
                                                        │
                                                        │
                                                        │
                                                 ┌─────────────┐
                                                 │             │
                                                 │    plots    │
                                                 │             │
                                                 └─────────────┘
```

**relationship cardinality** means the number of related entities in a relationship

- One-to-one relationship
- One-to-many relationship
- Many-to-many relationship

**one-to-one** relationship describes the relationship between two entities where an entity from group `A` may only be linked to an entity of group `B` and vice versa

​	one row in a table is only linked to one row in another table

```
┌──────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐
│              │       │             │
│    movies    │───────│    plots    │
│              │       │             │
└──────────────┘       └─────────────┘
```



**one-to-many** relationship describes the relationship between two entities where an entity from group `A` may be linked to many entities from group `B`, but a entity from group `B` is linked to only one entity of group `A`. For example, think of movies as group `A` and awards as group `B`. A movie can have many awards, but an award can only be given to one movie (per year).

phrasing: one state has many cities, but each city can only have one state

```
┌──────────────┐       ┌──────────────┐
│              │     ╱│              │
│    state     │───────│    cities    │
│              │     ╲│              │
└──────────────┘       └──────────────┘
```



**many-to-many** relationship describes the relationship between two entities where many entities of group `A` may be linked to many entities of group `B` and vice versa. For example, think of movies as group `A` and actors as group `B`. An actor can star in many movies and a movie can have many actors.

phrasing: leads to a new table inbetween them, a "join" table or a look-up table

```
┌──────────────┐       ┌─────────────────┐       ┌──────────────┐
│              │     ╱│                 │╲      │              │
│    pets      │───────│   pets_owners   │───────│    owners    │
│              │     ╲│                 │╱      │              │
└──────────────┘       └─────────────────┘       └──────────────┘
```

the pets_owners is an **associative entity**

### Why is an entity relationship useful?

​	help organize how to structure the database

​	good to show people who don't know code how the database is structured

**primary key** is the unique identifier of a table row, usually the `id` column. the primary key for every row in the same table is guaranteed to be unique and never reused.

**foreign key** is the unique identifier of a row stored in a foreign key column of another table. The name of a foreign key column is usually the singular form of the entity's table name with an `_id` suffix

​	In a one-to-many relationship, the primary key of one table row is stored as the foreign key in another table row

​	The table that the crow's foot touches is the table that needs the foreign key column

​	In a one-to-one relation, either of the two tables can have the foreign key column, but only one of them needs to have it

```
┌──────────────┐       ┌──────────────┐
│    movies    │       │    awards    │
│──────────────│       │──────────────│
│ id           │       │ id           │
│ title        │       │ movie_id     │
│ duration     │      ╱│ kind         │
│ rating       │───────│ name         │
│ genre        │      ╲│              │
│ is_3d        │       │              │
│ released_at  │       │              │
│ score        │       │              │
└──────────────┘       └──────────────┘
```

**column constraints** give you as much control over the data in your tables as you wish. If an application attempts to store data in a column that would violate a constraint, an error is raised

1. Not-null constraints
2. Unique constraints
3. Primary key constraints
4. Foreign key constraints

**not-null constraint** simply specifies that a column must not assume the null value. A table can have more than one column with a not-null constraint. 

​	The `serial` data type automatically adds not-null constraint to the column.

EX:

```sql
CREATE TABLE movies (
  id serial,
  title text,
  is_3d boolean NOT NULL
);
```

**unique constraint** ensures that the data contained in a column is unique among all the rows in the table. Adding a unique constraint automatically creates a unique index on the column, which is something we'll discuss later. A table can have more than one column with a unique constraint.

EX:

```sql
CREATE TABLE movies (
  id serial UNIQUE,
  title text,
  is_3d boolean NOT NULL
);
```

**primary key constraint** indicates that a column can be used as a unique identifier for rows in the table. This constraint requires the values in the primary key column to be both unique and not null. A table can only have one column with a primary key constraint

EX:

```sql
CREATE TABLE movies (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  title text,
  is_3d boolean NOT NULL
);
```

**foreign key constraint** specifies that the values in a column must match the values appearing in some row of another table. This constraint is used to maintain the referential integrity between two related tables. A table can have more than one column with a foreign key constraint. A foreign key constraint can also cascade the deletion of its specified row. In other words, when the referenced row is deleted, the row(s) referencing it should be automatically deleted as well.

​	Typically, a foreign key has a not-null constraint to prevent orphaned entities from being inserted.

EX:

```sql
CREATE TABLE movies (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  title text,
  is_3d boolean NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE awards (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  movie_id integer NOT NULL REFERENCES movies ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name text
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE movies (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  title text,
  duration integer,
  rating varchar(10),
  genre text,
  is_3d boolean NOT NULL,
  released_at timestamp with time zone,
  score numeric(3, 1)
);

CREATE TABLE actors (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  name text,
  bio text,
  birthed_at timestamp with time zone
);

CREATE TABLE actors_movies (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  actor_id integer NOT NULL REFERENCES actors ON DELETE CASCADE,
  movie_id integer NOT NULL REFERENCES movies ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role text
);
```



**join clause** is an optional part of a `SELECT` command that combines rows from two or more tables by joining on columns that are common to each. The combined rows can be viewed or even saved to a new table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies INNER JOIN awards ON awards.movie_id = movies.id;
```

5 types of join clauses

- `JOIN` OR `INNER JOIN`
- `LEFT JOIN`  OR `LEFT OUTER JOIN`
- `RIGHT JOIN` OR `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`
- `FULL JOIN` OR `FULL OUTER JOIN`
- `CROSS JOIN`or cartesian product
