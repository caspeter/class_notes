# Intro into SQL

**DDL** - data definition language

​	manage tables and indexes

​	CREATE - creates an object in the database

​	ALTER - modifies the structure of an existing object, ex: add a column

​	DROP - deletes an object in the database

**DML** - data manipulation language (CRUD)

​	**SELECT** - read

​		**SELECT [DISTINCT] fields**, FROM [tables], JOIN [tables], WHERE [criteria], ORDER BY [sort], GROUP BY [field], HAVING [criteria], LIMIT [# of results]

​		SELECT is the only one that you have to have

​		Best Practice:

​			Prefix field names with the table name

​			`SELECT VoteTypes.name FROM VoteTypes;`

​			Avoid using *, because * asks for everything back

​	**INSERT** - adds rows to an existing table

​		ex: `INSERT INTO MOVIES (RatingID, Name, MinAge) VALUES (1, 'R', 17)`

​	**UPDATE** - modifies an existing row

​		Adding a row: `INSERT INTO MOVIES (Title, Year) VALUES ('The Big Lebowski', 1998)`

​		You would need to alter the table before you set the RatingID

​		Updating a movie: `UPDATE MOVIES SET RatingID = 1  WHERE Title = 'The Big Lebowski'`

​	**DELETE** - delete from the ______________ table

stack overflow exercise: http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new

	AND SCORE > 4000
ORDER BY Score DESC;
```

**migration** is a file that contains SQL commands that are used to recreate tables



### In Class Practice

must create database first

\c into that database

then \dt shows you there are no tables in there

so we have to create a table now

```
CREATE TABLE movies (
  id serial,
  title text,
  duration integer,
  rating varchar(10),
  genre text,
  is_3d boolean NOT NULL,
  released_at timestamp with time zone,
  score numeric(3, 1)
);
```

​	(serial is good to have in every table.)

`\d` then lists the tables within that database

`\d movies` will look at the columns and types of the specified movie
