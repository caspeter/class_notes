# HTTP and Express

Separation of Concerns

​	keep the presentation and the data separate

HTTP Request/Response Cycle

​	Server - sends response to client (can be a client if it is making a request to an API or another server)

​	Client - requests into from server

## HTTP Request

1. A Method (or Verb) - POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH

   this is what I want the client tells the server

   CRUD

   ​	POST - Create

   ​	GET - Read

   ​	PUT - Replace

   ​	PATCH - Update/Modify

   ​	DELETE - delete

2. A Path

   How am I getting there?

3. An HTTP Version

4. Headers (Key-Value Pairs) - ex: authorization key

5. Body (optional) - gives data

## HTTP Response

1. HTTP Version

2. Status Code, 1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, 5XX

   200 - ok (this is a good one to see)

   302 - found

   303 - see other

   404 - not found

   500 - internal error

3. Headers (key-value pairs)

4. Body (optional)

## Express Server

**Express** is a library, built atop of the `http` module, that provides a minimal, flexible, and performant set of features that are fundamental to server-side web application development

**server-side application** is the class of programs that run on the backend, routing incoming HTTP requests to route handlers, and sending back HTTP responses that usually contain dynamic content from a database

The protocol is typcially `http` but it can also be `https` for secure communications. The default port is 80, but one can be set explicitly. The resourse path is the _local path_ to the resource on the server.

#### Objectives 

- Explain what Express is

  prewritten code so you don't have to write it

  minimalist  - simple, just what you need

  un-opinionated - there are no weird naming convention rules

- Explain what a route is

  a route is like a designated path

  determining how an application responds to a client at a particular point endpoint

  the route is in the URL

- Read and explain each line of a basic Express Server

  `var app = express()` - this initiallizes express, or invokes the function express

  `app.use(express.static('public'));` - public is a directory, static is a method that asks where your static (client side files) files are located. `app.use` is middleware, which says execute this function before you route

  ```javascript
  app.get('/api', function(req, res){
    res.send('Hello from the api');
  })
  ```

  ​	/api is the route, if they do a get request at that route, here is the function that will run. `req` is request, `res` is response. `res.send` converts objects before it sends them.

  ```javascript
  app.listen('3000', function(){
    console.log('listening on port 3000');
  })
  ```

  ​	listens on the port 3000 for requests

- Ports - 

  can give different parts of the code different ports to listen for different requests

- Build a sample full stack app with 1 route

- Use a checklist, build and burn, for making an express server

  1. initialize npm `npm init`
  2. install express locally `npm install --save express` 
  3. require express
  4. invoke express
  5. use middleware to serve static files
  6. create a route that hanldes a get requests for the main API route
  7. make the server listen on port 3000
