# GitHub – Master/Feature Branch Workflow

1.    Create Master GitHub – This is for the group to work on. Add permissions to collaborators so they can create feature branches.
2.    Git Clone Repo – clone the repo on your computer
3.    Create Feature Branch on GitHub - for new feature.
4.    Git pull origin master – This gets your local machine up to date with any changes done in GitHub on master including new feature branch.
5.    Git checkout branchname – This moves you into the new branch to work on.
6.    Work On Your Feature
7.    Git add – Add your changes to git
8.    Git Commit – commit your changes to your local branch
9.    Git pull origin master – This makes sure everything is current on your local machine
10.    Resolve Merge Conflicts – resolving merge conflicts from the feature branch
11.    Git push origin branchname – this pushes your change to the GitHub branch.
12.    On GitHub - Create new pull request – Compare and Pull (look at the changes, look for any conflicts, etc.)
13.    Make sure “Able To Merge” –on GitHub
14.    Create Pull Request – on GitHub
15.    Check for Changes – review changes, teammates can review and approve
16.    Merge Pull Request – Now Master is up to date.
17.    Move to new branch – git checkout master or get checkout newbranch – make sure you’re working on the right branch – git pull origin master to make sure you’re still up to date.
